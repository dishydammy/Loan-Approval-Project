# Overview
This project is for DataTalksClub MLZoomcamp Midterm project Cohort 2024. The loan approval process is a critical step for financial institutions, as it involves assessing the creditworthiness of applicants to minimize risks of applicants defaulting on their loans. Manually evaluating numerous applications can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. This project focuses on automating the loan approval process by building a machine learning model that predicts whether an applicant should be granted a loan based on their demographic, financial, and application details. The goal of this project is to streamline the decision-making process, improve the accuracy of predictions, and provide an unbiased, data-driven approach to loan approvals.
 
# Reproducability

This README file gives detailed step by step instruction of how to reproduce the project. The loan-approval-project notebook (loan-approval-project.ipynb) is the collection of all the steps in the experiment. The 

Data preparation
Data analasis
Training and Tuning of different models
Selecting and using final model
The most important notebooks are:

notebook.ipynb: That is the collection of any step of my experiment
eda.ipynb: For deeper insight I excluded the biggest part of data analysis to a separate notebook
train.ipynb: Contains each step to train a model / Contains the code for "train.py"
For the peer review you can just follow the steps here in this README file. Everything should work as described in this order. If you're not a peer reviewer or if you would like to dive deeper, feel free to also explore the other Jupyter notebooks.

The dataset was gotten from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data)
