# Overview
This project is for DataTalksClub MLZoomcamp Midterm project Cohort 2024. The loan approval process is a critical step for financial institutions, as it involves assessing the creditworthiness of applicants to minimize risks of applicants defaulting on their loans. Manually evaluating numerous applications can be time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. This project focuses on automating the loan approval process by building a machine learning model that predicts whether an applicant should be granted a loan based on their demographic, financial, and application details. The model was trained on a dataset containing historical loan application outcomes and features like income, credit history, and employment details. The goal of this project is to streamline the decision-making process, improve the accuracy of predictions, and provide an unbiased, data-driven approach to loan approvals.
